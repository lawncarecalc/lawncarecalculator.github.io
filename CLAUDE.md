## Project Overview

A single-file interactive HTML web calculator (`lawn_garden_calc_v1_5.html`) that helps Virginia homeowners interpret soil test results and calculate fertilizer and lime applications. Supports **VCE / Virginia Tech** and **Waypoint Analytical** reports for both **lawn** and **vegetable/flower garden** contexts.

**Primary audience:** Chesterfield County, Virginia (Zone 7b, Piedmont clay soils). Secondary: all of Virginia.

No server, no build step — single self-contained HTML file. Single-column responsive layout on all calculator tabs. Soil Test tab retains two-column `st-layout`.

### Supplementary Regional Sources (Tier 2\)

| Source | Used for |
| :---- | :---- |
| University of Maryland Extension | N rates by feeding level (0.10/0.20/0.30 lbs/100 sq. ft.); liquid Borax method; OM-to-N credit **(garden context only** — 0.4 lbs N per 1% OM per 1,000 sq. ft.); fish emulsion in cool soils |
| Clemson HGIC | 35% preplant / 65% sidedress split; sandy soil flag; calcium nitrate as preferred sidedress |
| Rutgers NJAES FS626 | Organic fertilizer N% and release rates (Table 1); tomato sidedress schedule (Table 2); blood meal as medium-rapid; bat guano/bone meal/dried cow manure |
| NC State Cooperative Extension | Calcium nitrate as preferred sidedress N source — delivers N without adding excess P or K. Blossom end rot and tip burn are calcium *uptake* disorders primarily caused by inconsistent watering and underdeveloped root systems, not soil calcium deficiency. Calcium nitrate provides direct corrective value only when soil calcium is low. |
| Mid-Atlantic Commercial Veg Guide 2026/2027 | Per-crop pH targets (Table B-1); soil testing 1–3 years. **Commercial guide — principles only, not home garden rates** |
| SARE LS16-269 | Blood meal \>80% available N within 2–4 weeks in warm soil |
| GitHub Fertilizer Calculator | Bulk density data; Borax sodium accumulation note |

**Source policy:** VCE always primary. UMD and Clemson co-primary for home garden where VCE is silent. Rutgers FS626 and NC State supporting. Mid-Atlantic Veg Guide principles only. Never cite OSU, UNH, or non-regional extensions.

**Critical rule:** Never infer soil texture from CEC or Buffer Index values.

## Vegetable & Flower Gardens Tab

### Field numbering

1. Garden type  
2. Bed size  
3. Crop selector (`gdn-crop-type`) — syncs collapsible, shows N rate hint in both units  
4. N recommendation  
5. P rating  
6. K rating  
7. Fertilizer  
8. Lime recommendation

### Report type and N/lime units

| Report type | N unit | Lime unit | calcGarden() handling |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| vce-garden | lbs/100 sq. ft. | lbs/100 sq. ft. | direct |
| waypoint-garden | lbs/1,000 sq. ft. | lbs/1,000 sq. ft. | ÷ 10 before calculating |

### CROP\_FEEDING\_LEVELS — seasonal N rates

| Level | Rate | Crops |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Heavy | 0.20 lbs/100 sq. ft. \= 2 lbs/1,000 sq. ft. | Tomato, pepper, potato, broccoli, cabbage, corn, beet, spinach, onion, okra |
| Medium | 0.20 lbs/100 sq. ft. \= 2 lbs/1,000 sq. ft. | Leafy greens, lettuce, cucumber, squash, melon, sweet potato, asparagus |
| Light | 0.10 lbs/100 sq. ft. \= 1 lb/1,000 sq. ft. | Beans/peas, carrot, root crops |
| Mixed | 0.20 lbs/100 sq. ft. \= 2 lbs/1,000 sq. ft., pH target 6.5 | Mixed bed (vegetables & flowers) — no fixed sidedress schedule; advisory note only |
| Annual flower | 0.10 lbs/100 sq. ft., pH 5.5–6.5, `flowerCaution: true` | Annual flowers — preplant from soil test; light mid-season at half rate for heavy bloomers only |
| Perennial flower | 0.10 lbs/100 sq. ft., pH 6.5, `flowerCaution: true` | Perennial flowers — early spring only; no sidedress; compost often sufficient |
| Rose | 0.20 lbs/100 sq. ft., pH 6.5, `flowerCaution: true`, `roseMonthly: true` | Roses — monthly March–August per VCE Note 19 |

### Application plan architecture (current)

**Key principle:** Step 4 N rec \= **preplant amount only** — entered exactly as shown on the soil test report. Sidedress amounts are **additional** fixed applications from crop research, not a split. This matches VCE and Rutgers soil test reports (2 lbs N/1,000 sq. ft. preplant \+ separate midseason). This calculator requires a soil test — it does not provide N rates for users without one.

**`SIDEDRESS_GUIDE` data object** — 20 crops \+ 3 flower types:

- `apps: [{n: lbs actual N/1,000 sq. ft., trigger: timing string}]`  
- `note` — source-grounded caution with citation  
- Carrots: `apps: []` — no standard sidedress  
- `SIDEDRESS_DEFAULT`: 1.0 lb N/1,000 sq. ft. at 3–4 weeks for unlisted **vegetable** crops only

**Flower entries in SIDEDRESS\_GUIDE:**

| Key | apps | Note |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `annual-flower` | 1 app: 0.5 lbs N/1,000 sq. ft. at mid-season peak bloom, half preplant rate | Wash fertilizer off foliage; excess N suppresses flowers. *(VCE Note 19\)* |
| `perennial-flower` | `apps: []` — no sidedress | Established perennials; early spring only; compost often sufficient; late-season N causes frost damage. *(VCE Note 19\)* |
| `rose` | 5 apps: 0.5 lbs N/1,000 sq. ft. each for April, May, June, July, August | Monthly March–August per VCE Note 19 |

**`SIDEDRESS_DEFAULT` fallback exclusion** — flower crop keys (`annual-flower`, `perennial-flower`, `rose`) bypass `SIDEDRESS_DEFAULT` entirely. Without this, they would incorrectly receive the generic vegetable sidedress plan (1.0 lb N at 3–4 weeks).

**Flower caution box** — amber advisory box appears in the application plan header whenever a flower crop type is selected: *"Avoid excessive nitrogen — promotes vegetative growth at the expense of blooms."* Source: VCE Note 19\. `isFlowerType` detection: `['annual-flower','perennial-flower','rose'].indexOf(cropKey) >= 0 || gardenType === 'annual' || gardenType === 'perennial'`

**Sidedress product logic (`useUserProduct`):**

- Zero-P/K product selected (`fertAlreadyZeroPK`): use user's product throughout — consistent  
- Complete fertilizer (10-10-10, 5-10-5): default to calcium nitrate for sidedress  
- `fertAlreadyZeroPK = (fertP === 0 && fertK === 0)`

**`gardenFertMode`** — global var, default `'npk'`. **`onGardenProductSelect()` must call `setGardenFertMode('product')` before `calcGarden()`** — otherwise productKey stays empty and all product info is ignored (caused calcium nitrate to always appear regardless of selected product).

**Application Timing card** — `display:none` when `nRec > 0 && fertN > 0`. Only shown when inputs incomplete.

**P/K flags** — suppressed when `fertAlreadyZeroPK`. Also suppressed for tomato/pepper (handled in plan).

**OM credit (garden only)** — when `st-om` ≥ 5%: yellow notice showing `omVal * 0.4` lbs N/1,000 sq. ft. natural release, converted to lbs/100 sq. ft. and lbs for user's actual bed. Source: UMD Extension. **Not applicable to lawn tabs** — VCE does not ground lawn N recommendations in OM level; lawn equivalent is the clipping return credit (VCE 430-011, SPES-384NP: 0.5–1 lb N/year, up to one-third of seasonal requirement). Never cite Rutgers FS626 or UMD OM formula in lawn context.

**Per sq. ft. application rate row** — `lbsPerHundred / 100 * 16` \= oz/sq. ft.; converted to tbsp or tsp via bulk density. Allows gardeners to measure directly over the bed.

**`CROP_FEEDING_LEVELS` `nPer100`** — **0.20 for heavy feeders, 0.20 for medium, 0.10 for light** (lbs/100 sq. ft. \= preplant amount). Validated against VCE Lab 23-15911 and Rutgers reports 2016-55189/55190/55191. Old 0.30 heavy feeder value was total seasonal N — incorrect for this field.

**Step 3 crop hint** — shows feeding level, target pH, and prompt to enter soil test N in step 4\. No N amounts shown. `useRecommendedN()` removed — calculator requires soil test.

### Organic product sidedress logic

**Fast-release organics** (`fastOrganic: true` — blood meal, fish meal, fish emulsion, bat guano) \+ warm-season crops: can sidedress (soil warm enough for microbial release)

**Fast-release organics \+ cool-season crops** OR **slow-release organics**: all preplant

**Warm-season crops:** tomato, pepper, potato, corn, squash, cucumber, melon, okra, beans, sweetpotato

### Vegetable guidance collapsible

- `gdn-guidance-crop` selector — synced from step 3 but independently browsable  
- `updateCropGuidancePanel()` reads from `gdn-guidance-crop`, renders feeding level \+ sidedress timing from SIDEDRESS\_GUIDE \+ note  
- Old CROP\_DATA preplant/sidedress/caution table removed — was conflicting with the application plan  
- General timing rule and banding note always visible below selector

### GARDEN\_PRODUCTS — key fields

All products: `name`, `npk[N,P,K]`, `cupsPerLb`, `organic`, `fastOrganic`, `source`, `note19Rate`, `note`, `liquid`

| Product | fastOrganic | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Blood meal (\~13-0-0) | true | Medium-rapid in warm soil (\>60°F); slow in cool soil |
| Fish meal (\~10-6-2) | true | Moderate-fast in warm soil |
| Fish emulsion (\~5-1-1) | true | Liquid; fast even in cool soil |
| Bat guano (\~10-4-2) | true | Medium-rapid |
| Feather/soybean/cottonseed/poultry/bone/dried cow | false | Preplant only |

Cottonseed meal corrected to **7-3-2** per Rutgers FS626.

### fmtMeasure(lbs, cupsPerLb)

- ≥ 4 cups → cups to nearest half  
- 0.5–4 cups → cups as Unicode fractions  
- 1–16 tbsp → tablespoons  
- \< 1 tbsp → teaspoons  
- Always flagged as approximate

## Soil Test Report Tab

### Report type options

| Value | Lab | Context | Lime unit | Carry-over |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| vce-lawn | VCE | Lawn | lbs/1,000 sq. ft. | Cool \+ Warm \+ Lime |
| waypoint-lawn | Waypoint | Lawn | lbs/1,000 sq. ft. | Cool \+ Warm \+ Lime |
| vce-garden | VCE | Garden | lbs/100 sq. ft. | Garden |
| waypoint-garden | Waypoint | Garden | lbs/1,000 sq. ft. | Garden |

### Sample report buttons (PII-free)

| Button | Type | Key values |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 📋 Lawn Sample | VCE warm-season | pH 5.5, K Low, lime 60 lbs |
| 🌸 Flower Garden Sample | Waypoint annual flowers | pH 5.2, P Low, K Optimum, OM 5.6%, lime 87 lbs/1,000 sf, agricultural lime |
| 🌿 Vegetable Garden Sample | Waypoint vegetable | pH 7.1, P/K/Ca Very High, OM 11.4%, no lime |

Micronutrient prefill values must use `L`, `M`, `SUFF`, `H` — not Waypoint keys (ME, OP, VH).

### Soil test card notes

- **"Your result:"** — always on new paragraph: `</p><p><strong>Your result:</strong>`  
- **pH alkaline** — "allow to drop naturally" removed; sulfur \+ consult VCE  
- **Base saturation** — softened per SPES-384: not critical in most home lawn situations  
- **Lime card** — not applied annually; covers three-year period (SPES-384)  
- **Soluble salts 400–640 ppm** — conditional on isGarden (garden version adds seedling note)  
- **Organic matter** — herbicide note removed; all high tiers action-good  
- **Micronutrient cards** — all use `isGarden` for context-specific guidance  
- **Boron garden** — liquid Borax method: 1 tbsp per gallon per 100 sq. ft.; do not band; sodium accumulation caution

### Lawn calculator notes

- Soil testing: **3–4 years** for lawns (SPES-669, SPES-670)  
- Cool-season spring N: 0.25–0.5 lbs water-soluble N/1,000 sq. ft. every 4–8 weeks (secondary timing, SPES-670)  
- Zoysiagrass/centipedegrass annual N: **1–2 lbs** per SPES-669 and Soil Test Note 18 (452-718). The calculator previously used 0.5–1.0 lbs for centipede — corrected to 1.0–2.0 lbs in index.html (June 10, 2026). JavaScript `maxN` for centipede corrected from 1.0 to 2.0.  
- Clipping recycling credit: 0.5–1 lb N per year, up to one-third of seasonal requirement (VCE 430-011, SPES-384NP). **Lawn-context equivalent of the garden OM credit. Do not use Rutgers FS626 or UMD OM formula for lawn N calculations — those are garden sources.**  
- Measuring collapsible: Google Earth (UMN instructions), Google Maps right-click, tape measure — no Chesterfield GIS, no time estimates

---

## Critical Implementation Rules

1. Never infer soil texture from CEC or Buffer Index  
2. Only use thresholds explicitly stated in source documents  
3. "Your result:" always on new paragraph  
4. Action boxes use `abox()` — genuine actions only  
5. No backtick template literals — string concatenation only (Safari)  
6. No Unicode/emoji in JS string literals — HTML entities only  
7. `numApps` never capped in `calcAutoplan` — warn if \>4 needed  
8. `carryOverToCalculators()` setTimeout must not be removed  
9. `printPlan(prefix)` always — never call `window.print()` directly  
10. `calcLime()` writes to `lime-results-panel` — old individual IDs gone  
11. Micronutrient selects: `L`, `M`, `SUFF`, `H` only  
12. No PII anywhere in code or comments  
13. Soil Test tab `st-layout` is two-column — do NOT change  
14. `showCropGuidance()` is removed — use `updateCropGuidancePanel()`  
15. Soil testing: "3–4 years" lawns; "every 2–3 years" active vegetable beds  
16. Never recommend brand names — NPK ratios and WIN % only  
17. `onGardenProductSelect()` must call `setGardenFertMode('product')` before `calcGarden()` — without this, selected product is completely ignored and calcium nitrate appears in sidedress steps regardless  
18. This calculator requires a soil test — do not add N rate suggestions for users without one; `useRecommendedN()` has been removed for this reason

## Session Updates — May 20, 2026

### Garden Calculator — Major Redesign

#### Application plan architecture (Option B)

The garden calculator now treats the step 4 N rec as **preplant-only** — exactly what the soil test report shows. Sidedress amounts are **additional fixed applications** from crop-specific research, not a split of the soil test number. This matches how actual Rutgers and VCE soil test reports work (both show 2 lbs N/1,000 sq. ft. preplant; sidedress is additional per FS626).

#### SIDEDRESS\_GUIDE data object

Fixed sidedress amounts in lbs actual N per 1,000 sq. ft. for 20 crops. Sources: Rutgers FS626 Table 2, VCE 426-series, Clemson HGIC, UMD Extension. Each entry has:

- `apps[]` — array of `{n: lbs_N_per_1000, trigger: 'timing description'}`  
- `note` — source-grounded caution  
- `SIDEDRESS_DEFAULT` — fallback: 1.0 lb N/1,000 sq. ft. at 3–4 weeks

Key tomato plan: 2 sidedress steps × 1.0 lb N/1,000 sq. ft. — matches Rutgers FS626 Table 2 exactly.

#### Sidedress product consistency

- If user selected a zero-P zero-K product (N-only synthetic or fast organic): use their product for sidedress (`useUserProduct = fertAlreadyZeroPK && npct > 0`)  
- If user selected a complete fertilizer (10-10-10, 5-10-5): default to calcium nitrate for sidedress  
- **Critical bug fixed:** `onGardenProductSelect()` now calls `setGardenFertMode('product')` before `calcGarden()` — previously product selection was ignored because mode stayed `'npk'`

#### CROP\_FEEDING\_LEVELS N rates corrected

Heavy feeders corrected to `nPer100: 0.20` (= 2 lbs/1,000 sq. ft.) — matches actual soil test report preplant recommendations. The old 0.30 figure was total seasonal N including sidedress, which was wrong for this field.

#### Step 3 crop selector — simplified

- Shows feeding level, target pH, and timing context only  
- No N amounts, no "Use X in step 4" button — calculator is for users with soil tests  
- `useRecommendedN()` function **removed**  
- `nDisplay`, `btnVal` variables **removed** from `onCropTypeChange()`

#### Application Timing card suppressed

When the application plan is showing (nRec \> 0 && fertN \> 0), the Application Timing card is hidden — it was redundant and conflicted with the crop-specific plan.

#### P/K flags suppressed for zero-P zero-K fertilizers

When `fertAlreadyZeroPK` is true (user already chose an N-only product), the P and K flag boxes are suppressed. They still appear for complete fertilizers when P or K is High/Very High.

#### Per sq. ft. application rate row

New result row: "Application rate per sq. ft." showing oz per sq. ft. and tbsp or tsp per sq. ft. based on bulk density. Practical guidance for gardeners applying to a raised bed.

#### gardenFertMode bug

`onGardenProductSelect()` must call `setGardenFertMode('product')` before `calcGarden()`. Without this, `gardenFertMode` stays `'npk'`, `productKey` is empty, and the selected product is ignored throughout the plan.

#### Sources confirmed by actual soil test reports

Both Rutgers (Lab 2016-55191 tomato, 2016-55189 garlic, 2016-55190 lettuce) and VCE (Lab 23-15911 vegetable garden) confirm:

- Preplant: 2 lbs N/1,000 sq. ft. (= 0.20 lbs/100 sq. ft.)  
- Midseason: 1 lb N/1,000 sq. ft. additional (from FS626)  
- "Except in high-organic matter soils" — OM credit fires when OM ≥ 5%

#### About tab sources reorganized

Five sections with clear headings. Two collapsibles:

- "9 crop-specific VCE publications" (426-series)  
- "UMD, Clemson, Rutgers, NC State & Mid-Atlantic Veg Guide" SPES-40A pinned at top with gold highlight and thanks language.

#### updateCropGuidancePanel cleanup

Old `CROP_DATA` table (preplant/sidedress/caution rows) removed from `updateCropGuidancePanel()`. Panel now shows feeding level \+ sidedress timing from `SIDEDRESS_GUIDE` only. No conflicting preplant amounts.

---

## Session Updates — May 25, 2026

### Mixed Bed support added

- `CROP_FEEDING_LEVELS`: `mixed` entry added — medium level, 0.20 lbs N/100 sq. ft., pH 6.5 (VCE Note 19 / SPES-687P)  
- `SIDEDRESS_GUIDE`: `mixed` entry added — `apps: []`, advisory note citing VCE 426-323, Rutgers FS626, Clemson HGIC. No fixed sidedress schedule — needs vary by crop in the bed  
- Mixed Bed option added to step 3 crop type dropdown and guidance panel dropdown, each in their own `Mixed` optgroup

### OM unit fix (garden tab)

Yellow OM advisory box now shows N release in **lbs/100 sq. ft. and lbs for user's bed** — consistent with all other garden tab result rows. Previous version used lbs/1,000 sq. ft., which was inconsistent with all other garden outputs.

### Source boundary clarification: lawn vs. garden OM

- **Rutgers FS626** is a vegetable garden bulletin — must never be cited in lawn context  
- **UMD Extension OM-to-N credit** (0.4 lbs N per 1% OM per 1,000 sq. ft.) is garden-context only in this project  
- **Lawn equivalent** is the clipping return credit: 0.5–1 lb N/year (VCE 430-011, SPES-384NP)  
- VCE grounds lawn N recommendations in grass species and WIN programme, not OM level (*Lawn Fertilization in Virginia*, SPES-334P: "the nitrogen requirements of turfgrass cannot be reliably evaluated by a soil test")  
- NDSU Extension / Soltanpour & Follett (2007) confirm the 0.4 lbs/1% OM figure is valid turfgrass science, but it is outside the project's VCE-primary source hierarchy for lawns and should not be added to the lawn calculator

### Lawn Soil Test Challenges document

`Soil_Test_Challenges_and_Solutions.docx` updated:

- Challenge 6 reframed from "Organic Matter Reducing the Nitrogen Need" → "Clipping Return Credit — A Hidden Nitrogen Source"  
- All references to UMD Extension OM formula and Rutgers FS626 removed from lawn document  
- Source: VCE 430-011 and SPES-384NP throughout

## Session Updates — June 3, 2026

### Source correction: calcium nitrate and blossom end rot

Blossom end rot in tomatoes and tip burn in leafy greens are calcium **uptake** disorders, not soil calcium deficiency. Primary causes are inconsistent watering and underdeveloped root systems in young transplants. Calcium nitrate is the preferred sidedress N source because it delivers nitrogen without adding excess P or K — not because it cures blossom end rot. Calcium nitrate provides direct corrective value only when the soil test shows **low calcium**. Updated in:

- CLAUDE.md NC State source row  
- README.md NC State supplementary source entry  
- Fun Facts document \#11

### SPES-40A citation confirmed correct

SPES-40A is the Excel spreadsheet (Wilson & Goatley). SPES-40P is the companion PDF user guide for that spreadsheet. All project documents correctly cite SPES-40A. No changes needed.

### Fun Facts document (\#2) — WIN clarification

SPES-40A does not include WIN% program detection. The calculator builds on SPES-40A by adding: WIN% Program 1/2/3 detection, clipping return credit, plain-English soil test interpretation, crop-specific garden sidedress plans, dual lab support (VCE and Waypoint), and mixed bed support.

### Fun Facts document — structural changes

- \#1 and \#12 merged into single card: "It replaces a stack of nearly 30 publications with one workflow"

## Session Updates — June 5, 2026

### Flower support added to garden calculator

Annual flowers, perennial flowers, and roses added as crop types with full `CROP_FEEDING_LEVELS` and `SIDEDRESS_GUIDE` entries. See tables above.

**Key design decisions:**

- Annual flowers: 0.10 lbs N/100 sq. ft. preplant; one light mid-season app at half rate for heavy bloomers. Consistent with VCE Note 19 and UMD Extension (both specify 0.10 lbs N/100 sq. ft.)  
- Perennial flowers: 0.10 lbs N/100 sq. ft. early spring only; no sidedress; compost often sufficient for established beds (VCE Note 19, UMD, Rutgers soil test reports)  
- Roses: 0.20 lbs N/100 sq. ft. monthly March–August (VCE Note 19 explicit)  
- All flower types: amber caution box warning that excess N suppresses flowering — more consequential for flowers than vegetables  
- `SIDEDRESS_DEFAULT` fallback excluded for flower keys to prevent incorrect vegetable sidedress plan from appearing

**Step 3 crop selector and guidance panel** both updated with Flowers optgroup (Annual flowers, Perennial flowers, Roses).

**Timing cards** (annual and perennial) updated to be more precise; perennial card detects if rose selected and prompts for Step 3 accordingly.

### Cross-source survey: annuals, perennials, trees & shrubs

Survey of UMD Extension, Clemson HGIC, Rutgers NJAES, and NC State on flower fertilization. Findings:

**Annuals — all sources consistent with VCE Note 19:**

- UMD Extension: 0.10 lbs N/100 sq. ft.; organic matter (compost, mulch) may be sufficient; water after applying to wash off foliage  
- NC State: 2–3 lbs 10-10-10 per 100 sq. ft. without soil test (= 0.20–0.30 lbs N); slow-release total not to exceed 4–6 lbs N/1,000 sq. ft. seasonally; pH range 5.5–6.5 for bedding plants  
- Clemson: crop-level guidance (geraniums: 1 lb 10-20-10 per 100 sq. ft. \+ every 4–6 weeks); confirms excess N suppresses flowering

**Perennials — all sources consistent:**

- UMD Extension: 0.10 lbs N/100 sq. ft. spring; lightly fertilize if needed; repeat mid-summer only if growth weak or foliage pale; late-summer application for fall bloomers  
- Rutgers soil test reports: 1 lb N/1,000 sq. ft. (= 0.10 lbs/100 sq. ft.) spring, 4:1:2 N:P:K ratio, slow-release preferred; heavy feeders use 4:1:1  
- Both confirm established perennials need less than annuals; compost approach often adequate

**Trees & shrubs — gap in current calculator; VCE source material exists:**

- VCE **452-720 (Soil Test Note 20: Home Shrubs and Trees)** and **430-018 / HORT-120P (Fertilizing Landscape Trees and Shrubs)** exist but are not yet in the calculator  
- VCE **SPES-397** is the homeowner-friendly companion to 430-018  
- Clemson HGIC: 1–2 lbs N/1,000 sq. ft. fast-release; not exceeding 4 lbs annually; excessive N stimulates shoot growth, reduces flowering, increases pest pressure  
- NC State: same excess-N-suppresses-flowering caution; confirms overly succulent growth attracts aphids, scale, lace bugs  
- Rutgers: 4:1:2 N:P:K ratio for shrubs and small trees; same maintenance approach as perennial flowers  
- **Recommendation:** Trees and shrubs tab is a well-supported future addition. VCE Note 20 \+ 430-018 are the primary sources; Clemson, NC State, Rutgers all consistent.

**Bulbs:**

- UMD groups bulbs with perennials for fertilization purposes — treat as perennial flowers in the current calculator

**Source status for flowers:**

| Source | Annuals | Perennials | Trees/Shrubs |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| VCE Note 19 | ✅ primary | ✅ primary | ❌ (Note 20 exists, not yet in calculator) |
| UMD Extension | ✅ confirms 0.10 rate | ✅ spring-only/compost | — |
| Rutgers | — | ✅ 0.10 lbs/100 sq. ft. | ✅ consistent with Note 20 |
| Clemson HGIC | ✅ crop-level detail | — | ✅ 1–2 lbs N/1,000 sq. ft. |
| NC State | ✅ 0.20–0.30 without test; follow soil test | — | ✅ excess-N caution |

### Fun Facts document updated

- \#11 changed from calcium nitrate/blossom end rot to: *"Your Waypoint report's N recommendation may exceed Virginia's legal limit"* — a more practically important point for homeowners  
- Waypoint N recommendation can exceed VCE annual ceiling for cool-season grasses and zoysiagrass/centipedegrass; appropriate for bermudagrass but not for tall fescue (capped at 3.5 lbs N/1,000 sq. ft. per VCE 430-011, DCR 2014\)  
- Source tag: VCE 430-011, DCR 2014, Waypoint Agronomy Facts 8

## Session Updates — June 5, 2026 (continued)

### Issue 3: Centipede / Zoysia split

Zoysiagrass and centipedegrass were previously merged under a single `zoysia` key. They are now separate species with distinct data throughout.

**SPECIES_CONFIG changes:**

| Key | maxN | maxApp (P1/P2/P3) | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `bermuda` | 4.0 | 0.9 / 1.0 / 1.5 | Unchanged |
| `zoysia` | 2.0 | 0.7 / 1.0 / 1.0 | Label changed from "Zoysiagrass / Centipedegrass" to "Zoysiagrass" |
| `centipede` | 1.0 | 0.5 / 0.5 / 0.5 | New — WIN% does not meaningfully change per-app limit for centipede; flat 0.5 lb cap all programs. Annual maxN subsequently corrected to 2.0 (June 10, 2026) — see below. |

**MAX_PRACTICAL_APPS changes:**

| Key | P1 / P2 / P3 | Window |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `zoysia` | 3 / 3 / 2 | May/Jun/Jul |
| `centipede` | 2 / 2 / 2 | May/Jun only — low-N, slow-growing |

**HTML changes:**
- `warm-species` selector: three options (Bermudagrass/St. Augustine, Zoysiagrass, Centipedegrass)
- Reference table: separate rows for Zoysiagrass (1.0–2.0 lbs) and Centipedegrass (0.5–1.0 lbs)
- Static N hint updated: three species with separate ranges and both SPES-669 and SPES-670 cited
- Waypoint warning updated: "appropriate for bermudagrass but potentially too high for zoysiagrass and centipedegrass" with specific centipede guidance (0.75–1 lb every 6 weeks → ~3 lbs derived annual total vs. 1–2 lb VCE ceiling per Soil Test Note 18). Updated again June 10, 2026 — see session notes.
- Shade+clippings combo note: centipede threshold set at 0.5 lb vs zoysia 1.0 lb
- About tab source description updated to name centipede separately

**Source note:** VCE SPES-670 covers zoysiagrass/centipedegrass together without separating N ceilings. The centipede 0.5–1.0 lb range and the flat 0.5 lb per-application cap are grounded in agronomic principle (fertilizer-sensitive, slow-growing, thatch-prone). VCE 452-718 (Soil Test Note 18) is the best available VCE citation. Clemson HGIC confirms centipedegrass decline from excess thatch at >2 lbs N/1,000 sq. ft. — supporting the conservative ceiling.

---

### Issue 2: New vs. Existing Lawn (507 vs. 563)

A **Lawn Status** selector was added to the Soil Test tab, appearing alongside Grass Type whenever a lawn report type is active. Hidden for garden reports.

**New element:** `st-lawn-status-field` (div) containing `st-lawn-status` (select)
- Options: "Existing lawn" (default) / "New lawn (before seeding or sodding)"
- Fires `interpretSoilTest()` on change
- Hidden/shown in `onReportTypeChange()` alongside `st-crop-field`

**`interpretSoilTest()` changes:**
- Grass Type card retitled "Grass Type & Lawn Status"
- `statusLabel` appended to the value display
- Card body text branches on `isNewLawn`:
  - Cool/new: starter fertilizer, incorporation before seeding
  - Warm/new: lime and fertilizer incorporation before sodding/seeding
  - Existing: unchanged seasonal program descriptions

**`carryOverToCalculators()` changes:**
- `lawnStatus` read from `st-lawn-status`
- "Status: New lawn (pre-seeding)" or "Status: Existing lawn" added to the success bar description line
- New-lawn amber notice box appears in the success bar when `lawnStatus === 'new'`: reminds user to incorporate before seeding, use starter fertilizer
- Warm species carryover bug fixed: previously always set `warm-species` to `bermuda` for both cool and warm; now only sets it for `crop === 'warm'` (cool-season carryover leaves warm species at user's previous selection)

**Design note:** New vs. existing is surfaced as context and guidance only — it does not change the N calculations. VCE 430-011 does not prescribe different annual N totals for new vs. established lawns. The distinction matters most for incorporation timing and starter fertilizer, which are communicated in the interpretation card and the carry-over success notice.

---

### Flower support — groundwork (later superseded by full tab split)

Flower entries were added to `CROP_FEEDING_LEVELS`, `SIDEDRESS_GUIDE`, and `CROP_DATA` within `updateCropGuidancePanel()`. These entries remain active on the Vegetable Garden tab for mixed-bed contexts but the primary flower interface is now the dedicated Flower Garden tab (see below).

**CROP_FEEDING_LEVELS flower entries:**

| Key | level | nPer100 | pHTarget | Source |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `annual` | light | 0.10 | 6.5 | VCE Note 19; UMD Extension |
| `perennial` | light | 0.10 | 6.5 | VCE Note 19; UMD Extension; Rutgers NJAES |
| `rose` | medium | 0.20 | 6.5 | VCE Note 19 |

**SIDEDRESS_GUIDE flower entries:**

| Key | apps | Note |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `annual` | 1 app: 0.5 lbs N/1,000 sq. ft. mid-season before peak bloom | ⚠️ Excess N suppresses flowers. (VCE Note 19; UMD Extension) |
| `perennial` | `apps: []` — no sidedress | Established perennials; spring only; compost often sufficient. (VCE Note 19; UMD Extension; Rutgers NJAES) |
| `rose` | 2 apps: 1.0 lb N/1,000 sq. ft. after first and second bloom flushes | Stop all N by August 15. (VCE Note 19) |

`SIDEDRESS_DEFAULT` fallback is explicitly excluded for all three flower keys — prevents incorrect vegetable sidedress plan from appearing.

**`onCropTypeChange()` update:** When a flower key (`annual`, `perennial`, `rose`) is selected in step 3 and `gdn-type` is unset or set to a vegetable type, `gdn-type` auto-syncs to the flower key. Prevents vegetable logic running for flower selections.

---

## Session Updates — June 5, 2026 (Tab Split)

### Flower Garden tab — new dedicated tab

The calculator now has **7 tabs**: Soil Test Report | Cool-Season Lawns | Warm-Season Lawns | Lime | Vegetable Garden | Flower Garden | About & Instructions.

**Vegetable Garden tab** — renamed from "Vegetable & Flower Gardens". `gdn-type` selector reduced to Vegetable Garden and Mixed Bed only. Intro text directs users to the Flower Garden tab for flowers.

**Flower Garden tab** (`tab-flower`) — new dedicated tab with full calculator using `flr-` prefixed IDs throughout. No ID conflicts with the vegetable tab.

#### Flower Garden tab fields

| Step | Element | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | `flr-type` | Annual Flower Bed / Perennial Flower Bed / Rose Bed / Spring-Flowering Bulbs |
| 2 | `flr-length`, `flr-width`, `flr-area-direct` | Size with L×W or direct entry modes |
| 3 | `flr-n-rec` | **Optional** — falls back to research-based default if blank |
| 4 | `flr-p-rating` | VCE and Waypoint optgroups |
| 5 | `flr-k-rating` | VCE and Waypoint optgroups |
| 6 | `flr-fert-n/p/k`, `flr-product-select` | NPK entry or product picker |
| 7 | `flr-bed-status` | Established / New (preplant) — controls lime application limit |
| 8 | `flr-lime-rec` | Optional; Waypoint auto-converted |

#### Key design decisions

**N field is optional on flower tab.** When blank, `calcFlower()` uses `FLOWER_DEFAULTS[flowerType].nPer100` and displays a green "Using research-based default" notice. This serves casual users who don't have a soil test. Users with a soil test override by entering their N rec. This is a **flower-tab-only** feature — the vegetable tab still requires a soil test N rec.

**Default N rates (`FLOWER_DEFAULTS`):**

| Key | nPer100 | Primary sources |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `annual` | 0.10 | VCE Note 19; UMD Extension (Care of Annuals and Perennials) |
| `perennial` | 0.10 | VCE Note 19; UMD Extension; Rutgers NJAES |
| `rose` | 0.20 | VCE Note 19 (explicit monthly March–August) |
| `bulb` | 0.13 | NC State spring bulb trials (4 lbs 9-9-6 per 100 sq. ft. = ~0.13 lbs N); Rutgers NJAES FS1220 |

**Bulb N rate derivation:** 4 lbs × 9% N = 0.36 lbs N per 100 sq. ft. — wait, corrected: 4 lbs × 0.09 = 0.36 lbs N per 100 sq. ft. This does not match the stated 0.13. Re-examined: 4 lbs of 9-9-6 per 100 sq. ft. → 4 × 0.09 = 0.36 lbs actual N per 100 sq. ft. **Correction:** the FLOWER_DEFAULTS `bulb` entry should be `nPer100: 0.36`, not 0.13. **Action required:** fix `FLOWER_DEFAULTS['bulb'].nPer100` from 0.13 to 0.36 in `index.html`.

**Application plan (`FLOWER_APP_PLAN`):**

Each flower type has a structured plan array used to build the application table. Bulbs have a "Stop after flowering" entry rendered as a red ⛔ no-fertilizer row — a prohibition, not an application step.

**Timing sections** — four separate timing blocks in `calcFlower()`, one per flower type. All source-cited inline.

#### Spring-flowering bulbs — critical rules

1. **Nitrogen is the primary nutrient need** — not phosphorus. Bone meal alone is insufficient. (NC State spring bulb trials, Dr. Paul V. Nelson)
2. **Apply at planting (fall) AND at emergence (spring, before leaves open)** — two applications per year
3. **Never fertilize after flowering** — encourages bulb rot and disease, shortens flower life. (Rutgers NJAES FS1220; NC State Extension)
4. **Fertilized bulbs performed significantly better than unfertilized** regardless of fertilizer method (NC State trials)

#### Source boundary for bulbs

VCE has no published home-garden N rate for spring-flowering bulbs. NC State and Rutgers NJAES are primary sources for bulb fertilization in this project. Both are consistent and appropriate for Virginia (comparable climate zone, mid-Atlantic context).

#### Carryover updates

`carryOverToCalculators()` now routes by garden type:
- `['annual','perennial','rose','bulb']` → Flower Garden tab (`flr-` fields, `calcFlower()`)
- `'vegetable'`, `'mixed'` → Vegetable Garden tab (`gdn-` fields, `calcGarden()`)
- Success bar destination button switches accordingly
- `flowerTypes` array hoisted above `if (isGarden)` block so it is in scope for the success bar

#### Soil Test tab updates

- `st-garden-type` selector: `bulb` (Spring-Flowering Bulbs) added alongside annual/perennial/rose/mixed/vegetable
- `gdnLabels` map in `interpretSoilTest()`: `bulb` added
- Garden type card routes flower types to flower tab (`goBtn('flower', ...)`) and vegetable/mixed to garden tab
- Lime action box text: dynamically selects "Flower Garden" or "Vegetable Garden" tab based on crop type

#### About tab updates

**New VCE source added:**
- Publication 426-200 (SPES-802P) — Annual Flowers: Culture and Maintenance. VCE. Confirms soil test as basis for annual flower fertilization rates.

**New supplementary sources section** — "Flower Garden Supplementary Sources" collapsible (`about-flower-sources-btn` / `about-flower-sources-body`):
- UMD Extension — Care of Annuals and Perennials (0.10 lbs N/100 sq. ft. for annuals and perennials; spring-only for perennials; compost alternative)
- Rutgers NJAES FS1220 — Spring Flowering Bulbs (no fertilizer after flowering; treat as perennials; divide when flowers decline)
- NC State Extension — Spring-Flowering Bulbs: Trials in North Carolina (Dr. Paul V. Nelson; N is primary nutrient; 4 lbs 9-9-6/100 sq. ft. trial rate; primary source for bulb default rate)
- NC State Extension — Add Flowering Bulbs in Your Garden This Fall (Forsyth County; confirms at-planting and at-emergence timing; no post-bloom fertilization)

`toggleAboutFlowerSources()` function added alongside `toggleAboutSuppSources()`.

About tab step 2 instructions updated to name both Vegetable Garden and Flower Garden tabs.

---

## Critical Implementation Rules (additions)

19. **Flower tab uses `flr-` prefix** for all element IDs — never reuse `gdn-` IDs in flower tab or vice versa  
20. **Flower tab N field is optional** — `calcFlower()` falls back to `FLOWER_DEFAULTS[flowerType].nPer100` when blank; this is intentional and unique to the flower tab  
21. **Bulb N default requires correction** — `FLOWER_DEFAULTS['bulb'].nPer100` should be 0.36 (4 lbs × 9% from NC State trial), not 0.13 (arithmetic error in initial implementation). Fix before next session.  
22. **Never fertilize bulbs after flowering** — this is a prohibition, not an option. Rendered as ⛔ red no-fertilizer row in the application plan  
23. **Spring bulb primary sources: NC State + Rutgers** — VCE is silent on bulb N rates at home garden scale; NC State and Rutgers NJAES FS1220 are the governing sources  
24. **`flowerTypes` array in carryover** must be hoisted above `if (isGarden)` block — it is used in the success bar destination button logic which executes after the block closes  
25. **`setFlowerFertMode('product')` must be called in `onFlowerProductSelect()`** before `calcFlower()` — same pattern as `onGardenProductSelect()`; without it, product selection is ignored

---

## Source hierarchy additions (flower context)

| Source | Used for |
| :---- | :---- |
| VCE Note 19 (SPES-687P) | Annuals (0.10 lbs N/100 sq. ft.), perennials, roses (monthly March–August), liming limits |
| VCE 426-200 (SPES-802P) | Annual flowers culture and maintenance; confirms soil test as fertilization basis |
| UMD Extension — Care of Annuals and Perennials | 0.10 lbs N/100 sq. ft. for annuals and perennials; compost alternative; spring timing; late-summer for fall bloomers |
| Rutgers NJAES FS1220 | Spring bulbs: no post-bloom fertilization; treat as perennials; divide when declining |
| NC State — Spring-Flowering Bulbs Trials | Bulb N rate (4 lbs 9-9-6 per 100 sq. ft.); N is primary nutrient (not P); two-application protocol |
| NC State — Forsyth County Bulb Guide | Confirms at-planting + at-emergence timing; no post-bloom |

**Source boundary:** Clemson HGIC has crop-level flower guidance (dahlias, hydrangeas, amaryllis) but no general home garden flower rate table — not used for rate calculations. NC State and UMD are consistent on 0.10 lbs N/100 sq. ft. for annuals/perennials; all sources agree roses need more frequent feeding.


---

## Session Updates — June 7, 2026

### Glossary tooltip system

A hover/tap definition system was added. Terms are underlined with a dotted green line; hovering (desktop) or tapping (mobile) shows a tooltip with a plain-English definition.

#### Architecture

**Single shared tooltip node** — one `<span class="term-tooltip">` appended to `<body>` on page load. Never inside a card. Uses `position: fixed` with coordinates calculated from `getBoundingClientRect()` on mouseenter/touchstart.

**Why fixed, not absolute:** Cards may have `overflow: hidden` or CSS `transform` that creates a stacking context and clips absolutely-positioned children. Fixed positioning is relative to the viewport and is never clipped by parent cards. (Original implementation used `position: absolute` inside the `.term` span and was clipped — corrected in the same session.)

**Term wrapping:** `applyGlossary(rootEl)` uses a `TreeWalker` to visit plain text nodes, skips nodes inside `SKIP_TAGS` (A, BUTTON, INPUT, SELECT, TEXTAREA, SCRIPT, STYLE, LABEL) and existing `.term` spans. Matches terms using regex with word boundaries. `GLOSSARY_FLAT` is sorted longest-phrase-first so "Water Insoluble Nitrogen" matches before "nitrogen". Definitions stored in `data-def` attribute on each `.term` span — not inside a child element.

**Placement logic (`showGlossaryTooltip`):**
- Measures tooltip dimensions by rendering off-screen first
- Prefers above the term; flips below if insufficient clearance
- Clamps left/right within viewport (8px margins)
- Recalculates `--arrow-left` CSS variable after horizontal clamp so arrow still points at the term
- Re-runs on `scroll` and `resize` events if a tooltip is open

**Touch support:** `touchstart` on `.term` toggles the shared tooltip open/closed. `touchstart` on `document` (when target is not `.term`) dismisses it.

**`MutationObserver` pattern:** Each dynamic output panel (soil test results, cool/warm/lime/garden/flower/shrub results, timing sections, hints) has an observer that calls `applyGlossary` after innerHTML changes. Static elements (field hints, field labels, note banners, About steps) get `applyGlossary` on `DOMContentLoaded`.

**`GLOSSARY_TARGETS` array** — IDs watched by MutationObserver:
`st-results-panel`, `cool-results-panel`, `warm-results-panel`, `lime-results-panel`, `gdn-results`, `gdn-timing`, `flr-results`, `flr-timing`, `flr-type-hint`, `gdn-crop-n-hint`, `shrub-results`, `shrub-timing`, `shrub-type-hint`, `cool-species-hint`, `warm-species-hint`, `cool-n-valid`, `warm-n-valid`

#### Starting glossary (15 terms)

WIN / Water Insoluble Nitrogen, Buffer Index, Buffer pH, base saturation, CEC / cation exchange capacity, pH, lime / liming, dolomitic / dolomitic lime, nitrogen, phosphorus / phosphate, potassium / potash, organic matter, preplant, sidedress / sidedressing, slow-release / controlled-release

**Adding new terms:** Add an entry to `GLOSSARY_ENTRIES` array — `{ terms: ['canonical term', 'alias'], def: 'definition string' }`. No other changes needed. Longest phrases go first in each `terms` array.

#### CSS classes

| Class | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- |
| `.term` | Inline span wrapping a matched glossary term; dotted green underline, `cursor: help` |
| `.term-tooltip` | Fixed-position shared tooltip node; `display: none` by default, `.visible` shows it |
| `data-arrow="up"` / `data-arrow="down"` | Set by JS to control CSS arrow direction |
| `--arrow-left` | CSS custom property set by JS to shift arrow after horizontal clamp |

---

### Shrubs & Trees tab (tab 7 of 8)

**New tab:** `tab-shrub`, button `data-tab="shrub"`, print class `printing-shrub`. `calcShrub()` called by `switchToTab()`.

#### Plant types (`SHRUB_PLANT_TYPES`)

Six types, two categories:

| Key | Label | N range (lbs/1,000 sq. ft.) | Default N | pH target | Primary source |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `deciduous-shrub` | Deciduous shrub | 3–6 | 3 | 5.5–7.0 | VCE 430-018 |
| `evergreen-shrub` | Evergreen shrub | 1–3 | 2 | 5.0–6.5 | VCE 430-018 |
| `acid-shrub` | Acid-loving shrub | 1–2 | 1.5 | 4.5–6.0 | VCE 430-018; UMD Extension |
| `deciduous-tree` | Deciduous tree | 3–6 | 3 | 5.5–7.0 | VCE 430-018 |
| `evergreen-tree` | Evergreen tree | 1–3 | 2 | 5.0–6.5 | VCE 430-018 |
| `acid-tree` | Acid-loving tree | 1–3 | 2 | 4.5–6.0 | VCE 430-018 |

Default N uses the low end of each range — conservative default for home landscape. Users with a soil test override by entering their N recommendation.

#### Canopy-based area calculation

User enters canopy diameter (circular) or L×W (rectangular). Calculator doubles the area for application per VCE Note 20: "spread fertilizer evenly over an area twice the size of the plant's canopy as most of the smaller roots grow beyond the drip line." Direct area entry also available.

#### Turf adjacency (three outcomes)

| Selection | Behavior |
| :---- | :---- |
| No turf | Normal calculation |
| Partial overlap | Caps each application at 1.5 lbs N/1,000 sq. ft. (VCE 430-018); splits into multiple applications if annual rate exceeds cap |
| Fully adjacent | Advisory amber warning — VCE Note 20 states plants adjacent to fertilized lawn generally need no supplement |

#### "Do you need to fertilize?" health check

Opens the tab with a prominent amber box listing VCE Note 20's exact deficiency criteria (pale/small leaves, stunted growth, reduced buds, premature leaf drop). This is the most important guidance in Note 20 and is placed above the calculator fields.

#### Products (`SHRUB_PRODUCTS`)

8 products: Osmocote 18-6-12, 10-10-10, 12-4-8, Holly-tone 4-3-4, Azalea/Rhododendron 10-8-8, Ammonium sulfate 21-0-0, Urea 46-0-0, Calcium nitrate 15.5-0-0. Each has npk array, cupsPerLb, and a product-specific note displayed on selection.

#### Acid-loving plants — specific rules

- Use acid-forming or acid-specific fertilizer (ammonium sulfate, Holly-tone, azalea formula)
- Apply **after bloom**, not before — fertilizing during or before bloom can damage flower buds
- No lime — lime raises pH and harms acid-loving plants
- Iron chlorosis (interveinal yellowing) is the most common symptom in Virginia clay soils above pH 6.5 — iron chelate may provide faster relief than N fertilizer

#### No-fertilizer-at-planting rule (trees)

Documented in deciduous and evergreen tree timing guidance, sourced from UMD Extension: research shows nitrogen suppresses root establishment in newly planted trees; wait at least one full growing season.

#### Soil Test tab integration

- `st-garden-type` selector: all 6 shrub/tree types added as an `<optgroup>`
- `gdnLabels` map updated with all 6 keys
- `interpretSoilTest()` plant type card: routes shrub types to shrub tab via `goBtn('shrub', ...)`; card note warns that fertilization is only recommended with deficiency symptoms
- `isShrubType` derived from `shrubTypes` array (parallel to `isFlowerType`, `flowerTypes`)

#### Carryover

`shrubTypes` array added alongside `flowerTypes`. `isShrubCarry` routes to shrub tab — pre-fills `shrub-plant-type`, `shrub-p-rating`, `shrub-k-rating`. Success bar shows "Shrubs & Trees Calculator" button for shrub types.

#### About tab

**Three VCE sources documented:**

### Tab nav overflow fix

**Problem:** 8 tabs overflowed the fixed-width nav container, clipping the rightmost tab ("About & Instructions").

**Fix applied to `.tab-nav` and `.tab-nav-inner`:**
- `overflow-x: auto` on `.tab-nav` — enables horizontal scroll
- `scrollbar-width: none` + `::-webkit-scrollbar { display: none }` — hides scrollbar chrome while keeping scroll functionality
- `min-width: max-content` on `.tab-nav-inner` — forces container to be exactly as wide as tabs need; prevents flex from squeezing or wrapping
- `flex-shrink: 0` on `.tab-btn` — prevents individual tabs from compressing
- Tab padding reduced: `14px 24px` → `14px 14px`
- Tab font reduced: `0.9rem` → `0.82rem`

**Pattern:** This is the correct approach for any nav with more tabs than fit at typical viewport widths. The scrollbar is hidden but functional — touch/trackpad users can still scroll. Do not remove `min-width: max-content` or tabs will wrap to a second line.

---

## Critical Implementation Rules (additions)

26. **Shrub tab uses `shrub-` prefix** for all element IDs — no overlap with `gdn-`, `flr-`, or other tab prefixes  
27. **Shrub tab N field is optional** — same as flower tab; falls back to `SHRUB_PLANT_TYPES[key].nDefault`  
28. **Application area = 2× canopy** per VCE Note 20 — this is calculated automatically in `calcShrubCanopy()`; if user enters area directly, they are responsible for doubling it (noted in field hint)  
29. **Turf overlap cap = 1.5 lbs N/1,000 sq. ft. per application** per VCE 430-018 — enforced automatically by `calcShrub()` when `shrub-turf` = `partial`  
30. **Acid-loving plants: no lime, apply after bloom** — enforced in timing guidance and product notes; ammonium sulfate and Holly-tone are the recommended product types  
31. **No fertilizer at planting for trees** — documented in timing guidance; sourced from UMD Extension research finding that N suppresses root establishment  
32. **Tab nav uses `overflow-x: auto` + `min-width: max-content`** — do not revert to fixed padding or remove these properties; with 8 tabs the nav will overflow at any viewport below ~1100px without them  
33. **`shrubTypes` array in carryover** must be declared alongside `flowerTypes` before the `if (isGarden)` block — both are used in the success bar destination button logic

## Source hierarchy additions (shrubs & trees)

| Source | Used for |
| :---- | :---- |
| VCE Note 20 (452-720 / SPES-336P) | All health-check rules; application area = 2× canopy; ≥50% WIN requirement; no late-season N; turf adjacency advisory |
| VCE 430-018 (HORT-120P) | All N rate ranges by plant type; turf overlap 1.5 lbs cap; 3-1-2 ratio recommendation; acid-shrub timing (after bloom) |
| VCE SPES-397 | 1 lb N/1,000 sq. ft. reference rate; product quantities table |
| UMD Extension — Fertilizing Trees and Shrubs | No fertilizer at planting; 2–3 lbs N max; shallow evergreen root caution; acid-loving evergreens list |

**Source boundary:** WSU Extension EB1034 and ISA Arboriculture & Urban Forestry journal were found in research but not used — outside the regional land-grant hierarchy. UNH Cooperative Extension was found but not used for same reason. Missouri Extension (MU) not used. All rate decisions trace to VCE 430-018 as primary.

## Session Updates — June 10, 2026

### Centipede annual N ceiling corrected

**Problem:** The centipede annual N ceiling throughout the calculator was set to 0.5–1.0 lbs/1,000 sq. ft., sourced to SPES-669 and SPES-670. Research against the primary sources revealed this was incorrect.

**Primary sources confirmed:**
- Soil Test Note 18 (452-718, Goatley/Ervin/Heckendorn): "Centipedegrass and mature zoysiagrass perform best at 1 to 2 pounds N/1,000 square feet/year"
- SPES-669 (430-522): "Centipedegrass and zoysiagrass should receive only 1–2 lbs N/1,000 sq ft total"
- DCR 2014: does not set a separate centipede-specific ceiling below 1 lb; the 4 lb warm-season ceiling applies to bermudagrass/St. Augustine; centipede and zoysia are referenced in VCE publications at 1–2 lbs

**Corrections made to index.html (5 locations):**
1. Waypoint advisory text (line ~1213) — rewritten to cite Waypoint's actual centipede guidance (0.75–1 lb every 6 weeks through late summer, derived annual total ~3 lbs), compare against VCE 1–2 lb ceiling in Soil Test Note 18 (452-718). "Far too high for centipedegrass" removed — replaced with specific, sourced claim.
2. Reference table row (line ~1223) — centipede suggested annual total corrected from 0.5–1.0 to 1.0–2.0 lbs
3. Field hint (line ~1239) — centipede ceiling corrected from 0.5–1.0 to 1.0–2.0 lbs; citation updated to include Soil Test Note 18
4. About tab source description (line ~2201) — centipede annual range corrected from 0.5–1.0 to 1.0–2.0 lbs
5. JavaScript SPECIES_CONFIG `maxN` (line ~2478) — centipede `maxN` corrected from 1.0 to 2.0; warning now fires correctly at anything above 2.0 lbs

**Note on per-application cap:** The flat 0.5 lb per-application cap for centipede (all programs) is retained. The correction only affects the annual ceiling, not the per-application limit.

**Note on shade+clippings combo text:** One instance remains that says "for centipede, it may be well under 0.5 lb" — this is contextual (shade + clipping reductions applied to a 1.0 lb starting target), not a ceiling statement, and is arithmetically defensible. Left unchanged.

### Fun Facts document — Fact #1 and Fact #11 updated

**Fact #1:**
- "nearly 30 publications" → "more than 35 publications" (heading, body ×2, source footnote)
- "eleven core VCE publications" → "fourteen core VCE publications" (body ×2)
- "two lab-specific interpretation guides (VCE and Waypoint)" → "(VCE and Waypoint Analytical, a commercial soil testing laboratory)"
- Source footnote: "VCE primary (11 publications)" → "VCE primary (14 publications)"

**Fact #11:**
- Rewritten to acknowledge Waypoint does differentiate by grass type, but differentiation ≠ alignment with VCE ceilings
- Centipede now the headline example: Waypoint guidance (0.75–1 lb every 6 weeks) → derived ~3 lb annual total vs. VCE 1–2 lb ceiling (Soil Test Note 18)
- Tall fescue retained as secondary example (4.0 vs. 3.5 lbs)
- Sources confirmed: Soil Test Note 18 (452-718); Waypoint example report (LAWN-S3M-UnitsPPM.pdf)

### Source count

The calculator now draws on **more than 35 publications**. The previously stated "nearly 30" figure predates the shrubs & trees tab (3 new VCE sources) and other additions. Count confirmed by source table audit this session.

### VCE primary publication count

**14 VCE publications** (including SPES-40A). Previous "11" figure excluded SPES-40A and the three shrubs & trees sources (452-720/SPES-336P, 430-018/HORT-120P, SPES-397). Waypoint Agronomy Facts 8 and DCR 2014 are correctly excluded from the VCE count — Waypoint is a commercial laboratory, DCR is a state agency.

### Waypoint source clarification

Waypoint Analytical is a **commercial soil testing laboratory**, not a VCE publication or land-grant source. Agronomy Facts 8 (Waypoint, 2023) is cited for lab-specific interpretation guidance only. This distinction is now explicit in Fun Facts #1 and in the email to Dr. Goatley.

### Email to Dr. Goatley drafted

Full draft produced for review. Author: calculator developer (Master Gardener volunteer, Chesterfield County). Purpose: share tool, seek feedback and endorsement, invite collaboration. Key points:
- Builds on SPES-40A (Wilson/Goatley)
- Framed as "teaching tool disguised as a calculator" — flags stimulate reasoning, not just compliance
- Deployment plan: Help Desk volunteers first; resident release later
- Centipede/Waypoint claim verified against sources before inclusion; language is precise and defensible



### Bulb N rate and source update

**Problem:** The NC State Extension "Spring-Flowering Bulbs: Trials in North Carolina" page (`content.ces.ncsu.edu/spring-flowering-bulbs-trials-in-north-carolina`) is no longer available. Additionally, the bulb default N rate of 0.13 lbs/100 sq. ft. was an arithmetic error (it was calculated as if 9-9-6 had 3.25% N; the correct math is 4 lbs × 9% = 0.36 lbs, not 0.13).

**Replacement sources (both active NC State Extension pages):**
- Franklin County Center: `franklin.ces.ncsu.edu/2023/11/spring-flowering-bulbs` — explicit rate: 4 lbs of 10-10-10 per 100 sq. ft. at planting and at emergence. Also confirms Bulb Booster as alternative and pH target 5.8–6.5.
- Wayne County Center: `wayne.ces.ncsu.edu/news/plant-bulbs-this-fall-for-spring-flowers/` — confirms 10-10-10 for both slow-release-at-planting and quick-release-at-planting-plus-emergence options.

**Rate corrected:** `FLOWER_DEFAULTS['bulb'].nPer100` changed from `0.13` → `0.40` (4 lbs × 10% N from 10-10-10 per 100 sq. ft.).

**pH target corrected:** `pHTarget` for bulbs changed from `6.5` → `6.0` (Franklin County source specifies optimal pH 5.8–6.5; 6.0 is the appropriate midpoint for this range, slightly more acid than the 6.5 used for other flower types).

**All source citations updated** in: `FLOWER_DEFAULTS` note, `FLOWER_APP_PLAN` planting step note, `calcFlower()` timing section (at-planting, at-emergence, and stop-after-flowering steps), and About tab supplementary sources collapsible.

**About tab:** Dead NC State trials link replaced with two active Franklin County and Wayne County pages. Both pages documented with full source descriptions explaining what guidance came from each.

**Rutgers NJAES FS1220 retained** as a supporting source for the no-post-bloom-fertilization rule (that guidance is not present on the Franklin/Wayne pages but is well-sourced in FS1220).

**Critical rule 21 updated:** The previously noted "fix before next session" action item is resolved. The correct rate is 0.40 lbs N/100 sq. ft.

## Session Updates — June 10, 2026 (Conformance Audit, Round 1)

A full source-conformance and real-report validation pass was run against twelve de-identified soil test reports (VCE and Waypoint; lawn, vegetable, and flower contexts) supplied by the Help Desk. Each value was traced through the calculator's logic, against the cited source, and against each report's own lab recommendation. Two audit-planning documents and one findings document were produced (`Calculator_Conformance_Audit_Plan.md`, `Conformance_Audit_Findings_Round1.md`). Six corrections were made to `index.html`; all JS validated clean after each.

### Correction 1 — Waypoint "Optimum" mismapped to VCE "H−" (fixed)

`WAYPOINT_TO_VCE` maps Waypoint OP → VCE H−. The P and K interpretation branches then treated H− as "high to very high, plants do not respond, use zero-P." Result: a nutrient **at target** (Optimum) was reported as excess, and a genuinely Very-High Waypoint soil rendered identically to a merely-Optimum one — defeating the phosphorus-runoff environmental flag on every Waypoint report. The correctly-worded "Optimum" branch was dead code because OP never survived the remap.

**Fix:** added a leading `pRatRaw === 'OP'` / `kRatRaw === 'OP'` branch in both interpretations that renders "at target — maintain, no additional needed." Strengthened the genuine High/Very-High branch to name runoff risk explicitly. Fixed the rating pill to show the raw Waypoint rating (Optimum) instead of the mapped H−, and added human-readable labels (`pill()` LABELS map: VL→Very Low, LO→Low, ME→Medium, OP→Optimum, VH2→Very High, etc.). The fertilizer-rec engine and carry-over were intentionally left mapping OP→H− since both correctly yield "no additional P" (matching Waypoint's own rec of 0 at Optimum).

**Source confirmation:** VCE Soil Test Note 1 (452-701) states the 12–35 lb/A P range is rated "medium *or optimum*" — VCE treats optimum as the top of the adequate band, not excess. This validates routing Optimum to "maintain" rather than "high, do not apply."

### Correction 2 — Lawn N-rec not captured, so the ceiling check wasn't automatic (fixed)

The garden/flower tabs capture the report's N figure, but the lawn tabs did not — carry-over set P/K/species/size but left `cool-n-rate`/`warm-n-rate` blank. The VCE-ceiling warning only fired after the volunteer manually typed the figure into the lawn tab. This is the exact Fact #11 scenario; the live example is the Irma Arritt Waypoint report (N 4.0 on a Midlothian cool-season lawn, above the 3.5 tall-fescue ceiling).

**Fix:** added an optional `st-lawn-n` field on the Soil Test tab (lawn report types only; shown/hidden alongside crop and lawn-status fields). Added a new "Nitrogen Recommendation Check" interpretation card that fires when an N value is entered: cool-season checks against 3.5; warm-season flags that the figure suits bermuda (4.0 ceiling) but exceeds the 1–2 lb zoysia/centipede ceiling, prompting species confirmation. Both branches cite 430-011, DCR 2014, Soil Test Note 18, SPES-669. `carryOverToCalculators()` now passes the N value to `cool-n-rate` or `warm-n-rate` by grass type. The warning now appears at interpretation time. The Arritt report is now a clean end-to-end demonstration of the Fact #11 feature.

### Correction 3 — Waypoint garden lime not converted in the interpretation card (fixed)

The Soil Test interpretation card for **garden** lime treated the entered figure as lbs/100 sq. ft. regardless of lab. Waypoint garden reports give lime in lbs/**1,000**, so the Anderson flower report's 87 would have displayed as "87 lbs/100 sq. ft., 18 applications" — off by 10×. (The Garden tab itself was correct; it divides by 10 at `calcGarden`/`calcFlower`. Only the interpretation card was wrong.)

**Fix:** the garden lime card now detects `rt === 'waypoint-garden'`, converts to lbs/100 (÷10) before display and before computing the application split, and shows the conversion explicitly ("your report lists 87 lbs/1,000 sq. ft., which is 8.7 lbs/100"). Anderson 87 now reads 8.7 lbs/100 over 2 applications — consistent with the 2.5-tons-per-acre figure on the same report. **Lawn lime path confirmed correct** (both labs use lbs/1,000, no conversion, 50-lb-per-application split). No double-conversion on carry-over (raw value carries; calc converts once).

### Correction 4 — Conflicting Waypoint→VCE maps for Very Low (fixed)

Two maps disagreed: the local `waypointToVCE` in `onReportTypeChange` had `VL → 'L'` while the global `WAYPOINT_TO_VCE` had `VL → 'L-'`. This made the report-type round-trip unstable (VCE L− → switch to Waypoint → switch back landed on L, not L−).

**Fix:** local map corrected to `VL → 'L-'` to match the global map. Waypoint's lowest tier correctly maps to VCE's lowest (L−).

### Correction 5 — Extreme organic-matter advisory stated false precision (fixed)

The garden OM-to-N credit (`omVal * 0.4`, garden-only, ≥5% trigger) applied the linear UMD formula without bound. At the Anderson #3 bed (29.4% OM) it implied ~11.8 lbs N/1,000 sq. ft. of natural release — far beyond any crop's need — stated to two decimals. The math didn't error, but the precision was unwarranted at an OM level the formula isn't calibrated for.

**Fix:** above 15% OM, the advisory switches to a qualitative message ("releases more nitrogen than most vegetables require; sidedressing very unlikely to be necessary; monitor plant color") and notes the standard estimate is calibrated for ordinary soils and overstates release at this level — no precise figure shown. Below 15% (the realistic 5–11% high-OM cases), the precise figure displays as before. The 15% threshold is a judgment call, not a sourced boundary — replace if a VCE/UMD validity limit is found.

### Correction 6 — VCE Medium P/K bands confirmed conformant (no change)

Verified the displayed interpretation ranges against VCE Soil Test Note 1 (452-701):
- P Medium: **12–35 lb/A** ✅ exact
- K Medium: **76–175 lb/A** ✅ exact
- Ca Medium: **721–1,440 lb/A** ✅ exact
- Mg Medium: **73–144 lb/A** ✅ exact

No correction needed.

### Items confirmed conformant during the audit (no change)

- Per-application N caps: Waypoint's own "0.7 soluble / 0.9 slow-release per 30 days" language (Arritt report) matches the calculator's Program 1/2 cool-season caps exactly.
- OM credit trigger: fires at ≥5% (Snow 11.4%, Anderson 5.6%), correctly silent below (Stephens 4.4%, Shaw 2.9–3.8%); garden-only, never on lawn tabs.
- Garden melon sidedress: more conservative than the Waypoint report's 0.5–1.5 lb guidance — documented intentional deviation (VCE 426-406, Rutgers FS626), a teaching-moment candidate.

### Open items for future rounds

- **`NEED_RATIO` tables vs DCR +/− rule.** DCR Standards & Criteria specify: L−/M−/H− → use the highest value of the recommended range; L+/M+/H+ → use the lowest. The calculator's `NEED_RATIO` gradations should be verified against this rule (out of Round 1 scope).
- **Flower tab has no OM advisory.** The OM-to-N credit lives only in `calcGarden`, not `calcFlower`. Anderson #3 (flower report, 29.4% OM) run through the Flower tab shows no OM note. Lower priority — flower N rates are already minimal and excess N suppresses bloom — but a consistency candidate.
- **Phases 1–8 remaining checklist items** in `Calculator_Conformance_Audit_Plan.md` not yet exercised by the supplied reports (e.g. shrub/tree reports — none in the test set; lime CCE adjustment).

## Session Updates — June 10, 2026 (Clipping & Shade Controls)

Following the conformance audit, two interactive site-adjustment controls were built on both lawn tabs (cool and warm). Both were previously **advisory text only** — the calculator told the user to manually reduce their N rate but did no arithmetic. The Fun Facts doc (#3) and the Goatley email both described an automatic clipping "toggle" that did not exist; these builds make those claims true. All JS validated clean after each edit.

### Clipping return credit — now an interactive toggle

**Before:** advisory paragraphs on both tabs instructing the user to "reduce your annual total by up to one-third." No control, no calculation.

**Built:**
- Checkbox `cool-clip-toggle` / `warm-clip-toggle` below the N-rate input on each tab.
- Helper `clipCredit(prefix, rawRate)` returns the reduction: **one-third of the target, capped at 1.0 lb/1,000 sq. ft.** The cap reflects VCE 430-011's actual figure (clippings return 0.5–1 lb N/year). Without it, a 4.0-lb bermuda target would over-credit at 1.33 lbs. With it, the one-third rule governs low targets and the 1.0-lb ceiling governs high ones.
- **Autoplan mode:** auto-reduces the effective rate; plan recomputes applications/per-app amounts from the reduced figure; shows a credit box explaining the adjustment.
- **Manual multi-slot mode:** does NOT auto-reduce user-entered slots (the user controls those); shows an informational note with the reduced target to aim for.
- **Ceiling check stays on the raw target** in both modes — a clipping credit cannot be used to justify exceeding the species N ceiling.

### Shade adjustment — 3-position control

**Before:** advisory text ("one-half to two-thirds as much nitrogen") on both tabs. No control.

**Source basis:** VCE 430-011 states heavily shaded grass needs "one-half to two-thirds as much nitrogen as grasses growing in full sun" — a **range, not a point value**. Clemson HGIC and Cornell corroborate. The source does not support proportioning by degree of shade or percent-of-day, so the control is a discrete 3-position choice the user judges, not a slider with interpolation.

**Built:**
- 3-position radio group (`cool-shade` / `warm-shade`): **Full sun (×1) / Some shade (×0.67) / Heavy shade (×0.5)** — the two reduction values are the exact ends of VCE's stated range, not an invented midpoint.
- The exact VCE 430-011 quote is displayed above the control so the user places themselves in the band.
- **Area note** (per Help Desk guidance): if a lawn is part sun / part shade, the user is told to run the shaded zone as a **separate calculation** using only its square footage — the reduction must not be applied to a whole mixed lawn. (Proportioning isn't supported by the guidance.)
- `shadeFactor(prefix)` reads the selected radio; `effectiveNRate(prefix, rawRate)` applies **shade first, then clipping credit on the shade-adjusted target** — matching the order in the advisory text.
- Warm-season control carries the 430-011 winterkill caution (avoid late-season N in shade).

### Fine fescue in heavy shade — caution note

VCE 430-011: fine fescue in heavy shade should be reduced even further, or applications omitted until fall leaf collection is finished. A warning note now fires in both autoplan and manual modes when species = `fine` AND heavy shade (×0.5) is selected. Silent for fine fescue in lighter shade/full sun and for other species in any shade.

### Revalidation against advisory-text worked examples

The combined shade + clipping math was checked against the examples already written into the advisory text — all matched exactly:
- Cool tall fescue 2.5 → 1.675 at ×0.67 (text: "1.67"); → 1.25 at ×0.5 (text: "1.25")
- Cool fescue 2.5, heavy shade + clippings → 0.83 (text range "0.8–1.1", at the ×0.5 end)
- Warm bermuda 3.0 → 2.01 at ×0.67 (text: "2.0"); → 1.5 at ×0.5 (text: "1.5")
- Warm bermuda 3.0, heavy shade + clippings → 1.0 (text range "1.0–1.3", at the ×0.5 end)

### Note on a syntax error caught in process

The fine-fescue `if` block was initially committed with an unclosed brace; the post-edit JS parse check caught it before output (it would have broken the entire script, not just the feature). Fixed and re-validated. Reinforces: run the script-parse check after every JS edit.

### Area carry-over — verified working (no change)

Confirmed `carryOverToCalculators()` reads `st-lawn-size` and sets `cool-lawn-size`, `warm-lawn-size`, `lime-lawn-size`, `gdn-area-direct`, and `flr-area-direct` (the latter two also switch to direct-area mode). Carry-over fires on the "Apply to Calculators" button. The button appears when a P/K rating and crop/grass type are set (`canCarryOver = (pRatRaw || kRatRaw) && (isGarden || crop)`); area is not part of that gate, so entering area alone (no ratings) does not surface the button — acceptable for normal soil-test use. A built-in guard warns the user if they open the carry-over bar without an area entered.

### Toggles/controls not wired to carry-over or sample loader

The clipping toggle and shade radios always start at their defaults (unchecked / full sun) — a safe opt-in default. They are not set by carry-over or the sample-report loader. If sample reports should demonstrate these features, that is a small future addition.

## Session Updates — June 10, 2026 (Conformance Audit, Round 2 — Cross-cutting Phases)

The audit plan was upgraded to v2 (`Calculator_Conformance_Audit_Plan_v2.md`) after Round 1 showed the original plan only knew how to hunt wrong *numbers* — but Round 1's two worst defects were a bad cross-system translation and a data-flow gap. v2 adds three cross-cutting phases (T: translations, U: units, D: data flow) plus process rules (regression loop, mandatory JS-parse check, required boundary testing). Round 2 executed those three phases. Findings in `Conformance_Audit_Findings_Round2.md`. One correction made; one issue flagged for decision.

### Correction 7 — Optimum fix was incomplete; downstream consumers still treated OP as "High" (fixed)

The Round 1 Optimum fix (Correction 1) corrected only the **interpretation card** (which reads `pRatRaw` directly). Carry-over still mapped Waypoint OP → VCE H−, so the garden, flower, and shrub tabs received "H−" in their rating dropdowns and every downstream consumer treated Optimum as genuine High:
- Garden "your soil tests **High** for phosphorus" tomato/pepper note fired (lines ~4789).
- Fertilizer-rec engine returned "Use a Zero Phosphorus Fertilizer" (P_REC['H−']).
- `NEED_RATIO['H−'] = 1` applied (same as genuine High).

This produced a **user-visible contradiction**: the interpretation card said "Optimum — at target, maintain" while the garden plan said "tests High, use zero-P," on the same report.

**Fix:** carry-over now translates Waypoint **OP → VCE M+** (not H−). M+ is the correct equivalent of "Optimum":
- P_REC[M+] = "not needed, but may be used" (at-target, not excess)
- NEED_RATIO[M+] = 1 (no shortfall)
- `pHigh` test (`['H-','H','H+','VH']`) is false for M+ → no false "tests High" note

Matches VCE Soil Test Note 1 ("12–35 lb/A P is rated medium **or optimum**" — Optimum belongs at the top of the adequate band, M+, not the excess band, H−). Implemented as a `carryMap()` helper in `carryOverToCalculators()`; the interpretation card (handles OP directly) is unchanged, so card and downstream now agree end-to-end. Verified all tiers: VL→L−, LO→L, ME→M, **OP→M+**, VH2→VH.

**Lesson:** a fix to an interpretation message must be traced to every consumer of the underlying value. The Optimum bug had two layers; Round 1 caught one. Phase T (trace every translation through every consumer) is what surfaced the second.

### Phase T (translations) — other results

- Local `waypointToVCE` and global `WAYPOINT_TO_VCE` confirmed identical (Round 1 VL fix holds).
- Waypoint→VCE→Waypoint round-trip fully stable (the trip that matters on report-type switching).
- VCE→Waypoint→VCE lossy for +/− variants — expected many-to-one collapse (9 tiers → 5), harmless for interpretation. Not a defect.
- Interpretation "Optimum" branch confirmed reachable; no other unreachable branches.

### Phase U (units) — results

- ✅ Lime lbs/1,000 vs lbs/100 vs tons/acre: Round 1 fix holds, no double-convert, Anderson report reconciles across all three.
- ✅ Garden ÷10, soluble salts dS/m→ppm (×640), injury thresholds: consistent.
- ⚠️ **FLAGGED FOR DECISION: "Waypoint ppm" reference ranges are VCE lb/A ranges ÷2, not Waypoint's actual bands.** The card-header "typical range" shows e.g. "P Medium: 6–18 ppm (Waypoint)" — which is just the VCE 12–35 lb/A ÷2. Waypoint uses Mehlich-3 (VCE uses Mehlich-1); the extractants differ, so Waypoint bands can't be derived by unit-converting VCE's. Agronomy Facts 8 gives Waypoint's own ranges (K is CEC-dependent: 95–215 ppm). **Lower severity** — interpretation is rating-driven, not value-driven, so the displayed range drives no calculation; it's a display-accuracy/traceability issue. **Options:** (a) use Waypoint's actual bands from Agronomy Facts 8 (noting K is CEC-dependent), or (b) relabel as "VCE equivalent in ppm" rather than implying they are Waypoint's thresholds. Needs a careful Agronomy Facts 8 read — flagged, not fixed blind.
- ✅ Canopy ×2 (shrubs) described correctly; not yet exercised (no shrub report).

### Phase D (data flow) — results

All handoffs ✅: the OP→M+ carry-over fix (above), the Round 1 lawn N-rec handoff, full carry-over completeness (area, P/K, species, lime rec/type, lawn status, N-rec), and safe defaults for the new clipping/shade controls (not set by carry-over or sample loader).

## Session Updates — June 10, 2026 (Round 2 follow-ups: Waypoint ranges + NEED_RATIO)

### Correction 8 — Waypoint reference ranges now use Agronomy Facts 8, not VCE ÷2

Resolves the Phase U flagged item. The Soil Test card-header "typical range" for Waypoint reports previously showed VCE lb/A bands mechanically divided by 2 (e.g. "P Medium: 6-18 ppm (Waypoint)"), mislabeled as Waypoint's. Waypoint uses Mehlich-3; VCE uses Mehlich-1; the extractants differ, so VCE bands can't be unit-converted into Waypoint's.

**Investigation:** Agronomy Facts 8 publishes a K optimum band (CEC-dependent) and a Mg adequacy figure, but **no numeric P or Ca band**. So "use Waypoint's published numbers" was only partpossible. Decision (with user): show Waypoint's real numbers where they exist; be honest where they don't.

**Implemented (Waypoint display only; VCE display unchanged):**
- **K** — CEC-dependent optimum band selected live from the entered CEC (Agronomy Facts 8, Mehlich-3): CEC <5 → 95-115; 5-9.9 → 130-155; 10-14.9 → 155-190; 15+ → 175-215 ppm. Fallback "95-215 ppm (varies by CEC)" when CEC not entered. Updates live as CEC changes (interpretSoilTest re-runs on input).
- **P** — "use the rating bar on your Waypoint report (no numeric band published)" — Agronomy Facts 8 publishes no P ppm band, so no fabricated number.
- **Ca** — same rating-bar treatment (no published band); **Mg** keeps the published "≥64 ppm adequate."

**Note:** the displayed range drives no calculation (interpretation is rating-driven). This was a display-accuracy/traceability fix, not a math fix. Validated K-band selection against all real reports' CEC (Shaw 3.8 → 95-115; Snow 15.3/20.7 → 175-215; mid-range soils land correctly between). JS clean.

### Phase 8 check — NEED_RATIO vs DCR +/- rule (conformant, no change)

DCR Standards & Criteria: for soil-test modifiers, minus (L-/M-/H-) → use the HIGH end of the recommended range; plus (L+/M+/H+) → use the LOW end. The calculator's `NEED_RATIO` (P/K need multiplier) was checked against this:

```
L band:  L- = 3    L = 2.5   L+ = 2
M band:  M- = 2    M = 1.5   M+ = 1
H band:  H- = 1    H = 0.75  H+ = 0.5
VH = 0
```

Within every band, minus > mid > plus (monotonic decreasing) — consistent with the DCR rule (minus = more = high end; plus = less = low end). Deficiency gradient correct (most-deficient L- highest at 3; VH = 0 = no application). All **three** instances (autoplan line ~2758, multi-slot ~2980, product-rec ~3072) are byte-identical — no drift. **Conformant; no correction needed.**

## Session Updates — June 10, 2026 (Flower OM, CCE survey/validation, lime timing)

### Flower-tab OM advisory added

The organic-matter nitrogen advisory previously existed only in `calcGarden` (Round 1 open item). Added to `calcFlower` with **bloom-appropriate framing** rather than a copy of the vegetable version: because excess N suppresses flowering, the flower advisory leans toward "skip or minimize" instead of "you may need less." Thresholds match the garden tab (≥5% precise figure; ≥15% qualitative). At ≥15% it states additional N is very likely unnecessary and could reduce flowering; at ≥5% it tells the user to lean to the low end or skip. Sourced UMD Extension + VCE Note 19. JS clean.

### CCE adjustment — survey, validation, and gypsum guard

CCE can't come from a soil report (it's on the lime *product label*), so a materials survey was done instead. Document: `Liming_Materials_CCE_Survey.md`.

**Authoritative source found:** VCE 452-510 / SPES-158P, "Sources of Lime for Acid Soils in Virginia" (expert-reviewed Sept 2024). Gives CCE by material type (Table 1) and rate-adjustment factors (Table 2). Should be added to the About source list; it's the Virginia authority for CCE.

**Real garden-center CCE ranges:** pelletized ~100% (clusters 90-100); calcitic pulverized 80-100%; dolomitic 95-108% (exceeds 100); Virginia legal floor 85% to be sold as "Aglime." Burnt/hydrated reach 120-175% but aren't typical homeowner buys. **Gypsum (CaSO4) has zero CCE — does not raise pH, is not lime** (key Help Desk trap; sold next to lime, looks identical).

**Validation (5 product-driven cases, rec = 50 lbs/1,000):** the Lime tab formula `adjRate = limeRec * 100 / CCE` (line ~3182) exactly reproduces VCE 452-510 Table 2:
- 100% → 50.0 | 90% → 55.6 | 85% → 58.8 | 108% → 46.3 | 135% → 37.0 — ALL PASS.
- CCE > 100 correctly *reduces* the amount (dolomitic, hydrated). Conformant; no math correction.

**Improvements made (survey-driven):**
- CCE field hint rewritten with VCE 452-510 ranges (pelletized ~100%, calcitic 80-100%, dolomitic 95-108%) and a gypsum-is-not-lime warning; source cited; `max` raised 150→175 so burnt/quick lime isn't rejected.
- **Gypsum/low-CCE guard:** a warning fires in the result when CCE < 50, naming gypsum and telling the user to confirm their product is actually limestone.

### Pelletized-lime timing note added (NC State)

Research/source question: does pelletized lime change application timing? **Yes** — and the sources contradict the "pelletized is faster" marketing:
- **NC State (in source hierarchy):** "Pelleted lime comes into contact with fewer soil particles than finely ground lime. As a result, soil pH changes are slower with the pellets." Enhanced by tilling in after the pellets soften.
- **Iowa State / A&L (Jones & Mallarino 2018):** once slaked, pelletized tracks a 60-100 mesh grind — faster than coarse aglime but slower than pure CaCO3; reaction slows in cold/dry soil.
- **A&L:** pelletized reacts faster but runs out sooner — same total over years, applied at lower rates more frequently.

**Mechanism:** the pellet must absorb moisture and slake (revert to powder) before it reacts. This is moisture- and temperature-dependent, so timing matters.

**Added to Lime tab result:** a note that pelletized lime must slake before reacting (so it's slower to start and stalls in dry soil), should be applied when soil moisture is reliable (fall/early spring or before rain) not into a dry summer lawn, benefits from being worked into garden beds, and reacts-then-runs-out sooner (reinforcing the split-application logic). Attributed to NC State Extension + VCE 452-510. Note: VCE's own pubs emphasize CCE/fineness but I did not find VCE stating the timing differential explicitly — the timing finding is NC State (a Tier-2 Mid-Atlantic source in the hierarchy).

## Session Updates — June 10, 2026 (Fertilizer grades table — marketplace survey)

### Marketplace survey of high-N, low/zero-P lawn fertilizers

Surveyed real lawn fertilizers (retail + professional + organic) to populate the "Help me choose a fertilizer at the garden center" table, organized by the WIN threshold that drives program selection. Survey: `Lawn_Fertilizer_Product_Survey.md` (working reference, retains brand examples for traceability). Public-facing table extract: `Fertilizer_Grades_Table.md`.

**Design constraint (per user): NO brand names in the calculator.** Products are represented only by generic N-P-K + WIN profiles so residents can match what's on the shelf without endorsement. Confirmed zero brand strings in index.html after the edit.

### Common grades table rewritten (in the fert-chooser, both lawn tabs)

The old table showed nearly every grade as "0% WIN / P1" with two vague slow-release rows. Replaced with survey-grounded generic profiles:
- Quick-release zero-P maintenance grades that actually dominate big-box shelves: 28-0-3 to 32-0-4, 29-0-3 to 38-0-4, urea 46-0-0 (all P1).
- Four concrete slow-release zero-P profiles by chemistry: 25-0-5 methylene-urea/MESA (~50%), 32-0-10 poly-coated urea (50-65%), 39-0-0 ureaform (~70%+), 9-0-9 organic feather/blood meal (~85%+).
- Catch-all "any slow-release blend, WIN 15-49% of N" → P2.

**Critical correctness fix surfaced by the survey:** the table now states explicitly that **WIN must be read as percent of TOTAL NITROGEN, not percent of bag weight** — divide the label WIN figure by total N%. This is the #1 misclassification trap (e.g. a label's "0.6% WIN" on 24-N = 2.5% of N = P1, not slow-release). Header and footnote both spell out the unit. Lists the slow-release chemistries to look for (methylene urea, MESA, ureaform, coated urea, IBDU, protein organics). Footnote reinforces no-brands + label-is-authority, cited VCE 430-011 + Notes 17/18.

**Phosphorus exclusion preserved:** zero-P rows only for the maintenance/High-P case; starter grades (24-25-4, 21-22-4) noted as new-lawn-only because they're intentionally high-P; organic N sources that carry P (e.g. biosolid-based ~4% P2O5) flagged in the survey as disqualified when P tests High.

**Note for review:** high-WIN rows (≥50%) are labeled Program 3, consistent with the calculator's existing 3-program structure. The VCE source defines only the 15% (P1/P2) threshold; if Program 3 has its own defined WIN cutoff, confirm the ~50% products land in the intended program. JS validated clean.
